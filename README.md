# Java-Compiler
Compiler that translate code into Assembly Language,
Building a compiler who compile java from assembly language

## Phases of Compiler

1. LEXICAL ANAYLIZER
Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences.Lexical analysis breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any white spaces or comments in the source code.

   |__ Firstly scanner remove all the whitespace and ignore the Comments and characters into one. with the help of regular languages and expressions, a convenient notation for specifying lexeme patterns.

      |__making token using source code

         |__then give to syntax analyzer
